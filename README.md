It provides a convenient interface to interact with token contracts, issue signup bonuses, automate token distributions, and enhance user engagement within your web app.

## Features

- Seamless integration of EVM tokens into web applications

- Issuing signup bonuses to new user accounts

- Providing daily login bonuses to incentivize user engagement

- Granting bonuses to paid users based on their payments

- Automated monthly token distributions to user wallets

- Email notifications for monthly token transfers

- Simplified interaction with token contracts using web3.js

## Installation

To install SriToken.js and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using the command line.

3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

   ```shell

   npm init -y

   ```

4. Install SriToken.js and the required dependencies (web3.js) by running the following command:

   ```shell

   npm install web3

   ```

## Usage

To use SriToken.js in your web application, follow these steps:

1. Import SriToken.js into your project:

   ```javascript

   const SriToken = require('path/to/SriToken.js');

   ```

2. Create an instance of the `SriToken` class, providing the necessary parameters:

   ```javascript

   const tokenContractAddress = '0xabcdef1234567890'; // Replace with your token contract address

   const evmNetworkName = 'mainnet'; // Replace with your EVM network name

   const webAppWalletAddress = '0xwebappwallet'; // Replace with your web app's wallet address

   

   const sriToken = new SriToken(tokenContractAddress, evmNetworkName, webAppWalletAddress);

   ```

3. Use the `sriToken` instance to leverage the available features, such as issuing bonuses and performing token transfers. For example:

   ```javascript

   // Issue signup bonus to a new user

   const newUserAddress = '0xnewuser';

   sriToken.issueSignupBonus(newUserAddress);

   

   // Issue daily login bonus to a user

   const userAddress = '0xuser1';

   sriToken.issueDailyLoginBonus(userAddress);

   

   // Issue bonus to a paid user based on payment amount

   const paidUserAddress = '0xpaiduser';

   const paymentAmount = 100; // Amount in dollars

   sriToken.issuePaidUserBonus(paidUserAddress, paymentAmount);

   

   // Send monthly tokens to all user wallets and send email notifications

   sriToken.sendMonthlyTokens();

   ```

4. Customize the library according to your specific requirements, such as modifying bonus amounts or adding additional functionality.

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to interact with the token contract on the specified EVM network. Also, make sure to configure your web3 provider to connect to the desired Ethereum network.
