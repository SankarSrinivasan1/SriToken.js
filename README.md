SriToken.js as a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies token-related operations on Ethereum and EVM networks.


Key features and benefits of SriToken.js, including:

- Token creation: Generate tokens on Ethereum and EVM networks.

- Web3.js integration: Seamlessly interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js.

- User signup: Enable user registration and token distribution.

- Activity rewards: Incentivize users by rewarding tokens for specific activities.

- Token transfers: Facilitate secure and efficient token transfers between users.

- Balance retrieval: Retrieve the token balance of user accounts.

### Getting Started

To install the `SriToken.js` library, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org

2. Open your command-line interface or terminal.

3. Navigate to your project directory.

4. Run the following command to install the `SriToken.js` library from npm:

   ```bash
   npm install sritoken
   ```

   This command will fetch the latest version of the library from the npm registry and install it in your project's `node_modules` directory.

5. Once the installation is complete, you can import the `SriToken` class in your JavaScript files using the `require` or `import` statement, depending on your project setup.

   ```javascript
   // Using require
   const SriToken = require('sritoken');

   // Using import
   import SriToken from 'sritoken';
   ```

6. You're now ready to use the `SriToken.js` library in your project! Initialize an instance of `SriToken` with the appropriate network URL, contract address, and contract ABI, and start interacting with Ethereum and EVM networks for token-related operations.

   ```javascript
   const sriToken = new SriToken(networkUrl, contractAddress, contractAbi);
   ```

Make sure to replace `networkUrl`, `contractAddress`, and `contractAbi` with the actual values specific to your token contract.

That's it! You have successfully installed the `SriToken.js` library and can begin using it in your project to create tokens, manage user signups, reward activities, perform token transfers, and retrieve token balances on Ethereum and EVM networks.
