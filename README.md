# SriToken.js
## A JavaScript Library for creating tokens on Ethereum and EVM Networks, for webapp users to reward for signups and activities 
SriToken.js as a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies token-related operations on Ethereum and EVM networks.

Key features and benefits of SriToken.js, including:
- Token creation: Generate tokens on Ethereum and EVM networks.
- Web3.js integration: Seamlessly interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js.
- User signup: Enable user registration and token distribution.
- Activity rewards: Incentivize users by rewarding tokens for specific activities.
- Token transfers: Facilitate secure and efficient token transfers between users.
- Balance retrieval: Retrieve the token balance of user accounts.

### Getting Started
To install the `SriToken.js` library, you can follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org
2. Open your command-line interface or terminal.
3. Navigate to your project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the `SriToken.js` library from npm:
   ```bash
   npm install sritoken
   ```
   This command will fetch the latest version of the library from the npm registry and install it in your project's `node_modules` directory.
5. Once the installation is complete, you can import the `SriToken` class in your JavaScript files using the `require` or `import` statement, depending on your project setup.
   ```javascript
   // Using require
   const SriToken = require('sritoken');
   // Using import
   import SriToken from 'sritoken';
   ```
6. You're now ready to use the `SriToken.js` library in your project! Initialize an instance of `SriToken` with the appropriate network URL, contract address, and contract ABI, and start interacting with Ethereum and EVM networks for token-related operations.
   ```javascript
   const sriToken = new SriToken(networkUrl, contractAddress, contractAbi);
   ```
Make sure to replace `networkUrl`, `contractAddress`, and `contractAbi` with the actual values specific to your token contract.

That's it! You have successfully installed the `SriToken.js` library and can begin using it in your project to create tokens, manage user signups, reward activities, perform token transfers, and retrieve token balances on Ethereum and EVM networks.

### Usage Examples

3. Examples and Usage
Let's get started!

## 1. Library Design and Features
Based on your requirements, here are the features we'll include in the `SriToken.js` library:
- Token creation: Generate tokens on Ethereum and EVM networks.
- Web3.js integration: Interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js.
- User signup: Allow web app users to sign up and receive tokens.
- Activity rewards: Reward users with tokens for performing activities.
- Token transfers: Enable token transfers between users.
- Balance retrieval: Get the token balance of a user's account.

## 2. Library Implementation (SriToken.js)
Now, let's implement the `SriToken.js` library with the desired features. Here's an example of how it could be structured:
```javascript
// SriToken.js
// Import necessary dependencies
const Web3 = require('web3');
class SriToken {
  constructor(networkUrl, contractAddress, contractAbi) {
    this.web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(networkUrl));
    this.contract = new this.web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress);
  }
  async createToken(userAddress, tokenAmount) {
    // Implement token creation logic using the contract ABI
    // Use the web3 instance to interact with the contract
    // Return a promise that resolves when the token creation is successful
  }
  async signup(userAddress) {
    // Implement user signup logic using the contract ABI
    // Use the web3 instance to interact with the contract
    // Return a promise that resolves when the signup is successful
  }
  async rewardActivity(userAddress, activityType) {
    // Implement activity reward logic using the contract ABI
    // Use the web3 instance to interact with the contract
    // Return a promise that resolves when the activity reward is successful
  }
  async transferTokens(fromAddress, toAddress, tokenAmount) {
    // Implement token transfer logic using the contract ABI
    // Use the web3 instance to interact with the contract
    // Return a promise that resolves when the token transfer is successful
  }
  async getTokenBalance(userAddress) {
    // Implement token balance retrieval logic using the contract ABI
    // Use the web3 instance to interact with the contract
    // Return a promise that resolves with the user's token balance
  }
}
module.exports = SriToken;
```
Please note that the above code is a basic framework, and you'll need to replace the placeholders (`networkUrl`, `contractAddress`, `contractAbi`) with the actual values specific to your token contract.

## 3. Examples and Usage
To demonstrate the usage of the `SriToken.js` library, here are some example code snippets:

### Creating a token
```javascript
const SriToken = require('SriToken');
const networkUrl = 'https://your-network-url';
const contractAddress = '0x123456789abcdef';
const contractAbi = [...]; // The ABI of your token contract
const sriToken = new SriToken(networkUrl, contractAddress, contractAbi);
sriToken.createToken('0xuser', 100)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Token created successfully!');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error creating token:', error);
  });
```

- User signup: Show how to register users and distribute tokens upon signup.
```javascript
const sriToken = new SriToken(networkUrl, contractAddress, contractAbi);
sriToken.signup('0xuser')
  .then(() => {
    console.log('User signed up successfully!');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error signing up:', error);
  });
```

- Rewarding activities: Illustrate how to reward users with tokens for specific activities.
- Token transfers: Guide users on securely transferring tokens between accounts.
- Balance retrieval: Explain how to retrieve the token balance of user accounts.
